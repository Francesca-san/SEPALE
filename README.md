Hi there,

This is our month work on the SEPALE project. You'll find here mostly notebooks with detailed explanations and python scripts for specific functions. Up to this point, work for all the exercise whether they are AFC (2 and 5), AX and Oddity. 
The notebooks are organised in chronological order, which means that you'll first find functions to parse and clean the txt files, then to make plots of the results. Then you'll be able to analyse all the logfiles for a single student, and finally the exercises for all the students in a classroom.
There is still room for improvement, so do not hesitate to tell me if you see some pieces of code that should be modified first, or if you have any advice!

Have a very nice day!
